ROJECT NAME : STUDENT GRADE TRACKER Project Overview:

1.Student Grade Tracker is a Java console-based application developed to manage and analyze student academic performance.

2.The program allows users to enter student names and marks, calculate statistical values such as average, highest, and lowest scores, and automatically assign grades based on predefined criteria.

3.This project demonstrates core Java programming skills and object-oriented programming principles.

FEATURES:

1.Add multiple student records dynamically

2.Store student data using ArrayList

3.Calculate average marks

4.Identify highest and lowest scores

5.Automatically assign grades (A, B, C, Fail)

6.Validate user input (marks between 0–100)

7.Display a formatted summary report

TECHNOLOGIES USED:-

1.Java

2.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

3.ArrayList

4.Scanner Class

5.Conditional Statements

6.Loops

*CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED

1.Class and Object creation

2.Constructor usage

3.Method implementation

4.Encapsulation

5.Data handling using collections

6.Input validation
